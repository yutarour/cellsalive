## Why I'm doing this:
- Cells alive (which I and my bio teacher used for HS biology was discontinued after 30 years.) The author, Jim Sullivan, states on https://www.cellsalive.com/ : 
- >It has been a pleasure and privilege providing CELLS alive! for thirty years. Its online presence may have ended but an offline version of the site is available below free of charge.
The offline version is a complete working site, including Ouch!, the burping macrophage, interactive animations (Cell Model, Mitosis, HowBig?), matching games, and jigsaw puzzles. Instructions for installation on your computer are in the 78mb ZIP download. Install it on classroom computers or share copies of the ZIP file with others. The online CELLS alive! was always free. Sharing the offline site with others should be free as well.
Thank you to everyone over a long and fruitful association. I wish the best for your future endeavors. And may you all discover something as fulfilling as this venture has been for me.

- The author is very generous in giving us the entire source code for this incredible piece of history and detailed instructions on how to run it [document](READ_ME_FIRST.rtf). However, in the case that there may be people who do not know how to run it themselves, I provide this to you.
